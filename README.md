# Olx

Olx clone in Django

## Getting started

To get started clone this repository and make sure you have `python==3.8.5` installed in your system.
Create a virtual environment and install requirements and that's pretty much it!

```
git clone https://gitlab.arbisoft.com/m.sameer/olx.git
cd olx
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
